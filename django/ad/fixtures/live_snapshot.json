So RH1 is \r\nRedhill itself, RH10 is Crawley. With larger towns there may be more than 1 number \r\nin the outward section - Crawley includes RH10 and RH11. The 'Inward' part denotes \r\nparticular parts of the town / Delivery Office area, with the first part - the number - \r\nbeing a sector, and the final two letters denoting a group of houses within that area.\r\n\r\nFor more see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_the_United_Kingdom).\r\n\r\n## To Find a Postcode\r\n\r\n1. Go to [postcode.royalmail.com](http://postcode.royalmail.com).\r\n2. Enter the Building Number or Building Name in the fields provided.\r\n3. Enter the Street name.\r\n4. The previous two values are often sufficient but to reduce the \r\n   number of matches you can enter the Town name as well.\r\n5. Press the \"Find Postcode\" button.\r\n6. All matching addresses and postcodes are listed. \r\n   Click on one to see a map showing its location.\r\n\r\n## To Find an Address from a Postcode\r\n\r\n1. Go to [postcode.royalmail.com](http://postcode.royalmail.com).\r\n2. Click on the \"Find an address\" tab.\r\n3. Enter the Postcode in the field provided.\r\n4. Press the \"Find an Address\" button.\r\n5. The address is displayed along with a map showing its location.\r\n"

E.g. Bash `#!/bin/sh`; Python 3.1 `#!/usr/bin/python3.1`.\n\n## Bash/zsh Command Line\n\n* Make the command-line prompt reflect Version Control using [vcprompt](/vcprompt/).\n* Terminal Multiplexer Byobu\n([Man Page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/en/man1/byobu.1.html);\nAdd new terminal: `F2`; Scroll through terminals: `F3` and `F4`).\n* Change your password: `passwd`\n* Repeatedly run command: `watch -d -n 0.5 [command]`\n* Count number of files in current directory: `ls -l | wc -l`\n* Search for string in files (include sub-directories): `grep -rl \"string\" *`.\n* Delete all empty `.xml` files: `find . -name \"*.xml\" -size 0 -exec rm {} \\;`.\n* Recursively remove folders and their contents: `rm -rf`.\n* List files with **/** added to directory names and **\\*** to executables: `ls -F`.\n* Mass rename: `zmv -n (*).txt $1.tmp` (`-n` option shows result but does not make the change)\n* Checksum: `md5sum ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso`.\n* Find which executable will be used: `which python`.\n* Change to the previous working directory: `cd -`.\n* Substitution: `!$` Repeats last argument of previous command; `!!` Repeat previous line command; `^foo^bar^` Repeat the previous shell command but replace string \"foo\" with \"bar\".\n* `echo $?`: Display exit code.\n* `su userid`: Switch User.\n* traceroute and ping combined: `mtr google.com`.\n* Run graphical application as root: `gksudo nautilus`.\n* Create link: `ln [-s] file [link]`.\n* Reconnect to network connection by restarting network manager service: `sudo service network-manager restart`.\n* Monitor several logs: `tail -f [logfile1] [logfile2]...`.\n* `df`: Show disk usage.\n* Job Control: `jobs` List background jobs; `bg [jobspec]` Run job in background; `fg [jobspec]` Bring specific or most recent job to foreground; `kill %1` Kill first listed job.\n\n## Ultimate Linux Shutdown Process\n\nIf all is stuck, and even Ctrl+Alt+backspace does not work, remember this mnemonic: **R**aising **S**kinny **E**lephants **I**s **U**tterly **B**oring:\n\n* ALT+SysRq+**r** (put keyboard in raw mode)\n* ALT+SysRq+**s** (sync the disk)\n* ALT+SysRq+**e** (terminate all processes)\n* ALT+SysRq+**i** (kill all processes)\n* ALT+SysRq+**u** (remount all file systems read only)\n* ALT+SysRq+**b** (reboot the system)\n\n(SysRq is the same button as print screen on most keyboards)\n\nLess drastically, you can use ALT+SysRq+**k** to kill all processes on the current virtual console (has the effect of restarting the X server).\n\nSysRq is disabled by default so you will have to edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and change the `kernel.sysrq` value to `1` (and then reboot) to enable these shortcut keys.\n\n## Ubuntu\n\n### Settings\n\n* Bulk change file associations: `sudo vi /usr/share/applications/defaults.list`\n    * `:%s/gedit/geany/g` Change default text editor from gedit to geany.\n* Prevent keyobard resetting to US layout after reboot:\n    1. In `dconf-editor`, navigate to `desktop > ibus > general`.\n    1. Enable `use-system-keyboard-layout`.\n* Disable auto-open of Nautilus on drive mount: `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open false`\n* Stop Wifi being activated after boot ([from](http://www.hecticgeek.com/2012/10/ubuntu-automatically-turns-on-bluetooth-fix/)):\n    1. `sudo vi /etc/rc.local`\n    1. Add line: `rfkill block wifi`\n    1. Also, to keep Bluetooth deactivated): `rfkill block bluetooth`\n* Enable `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` to restart the X server, to recover after the Desktop Environment freezes:\n    1. `sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration`\n    1. Accept first 5 keyboard options.\n    1. Choose `Yes` to use `Control+Alt+Backspace` to terminate the X server.\n\n### OpenDNS\n\nAdd OpenDNS servers by editing `/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf` and appending the following line to the document:\n\n    prepend domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220;\n\n### Logout Keyboard Shortcut\n\nTo re-enable Control+Alt+Backspace shortcut to kill the X server:\n\n1. Open Keyboard preferences.\n1. Choose Layouts Tab.\n1. Press Options Button.\n1. Find \"Key sequence to kill the x server' option on list.\n1. Tick to enable.\n\n### Monitor Network Usage\n\n1. Install vnstat: `sudo apt-get install vnstat`.\n1. Create database: `sudo vnstat -u -i eth0`.\n1. Show monthly usage: `vnstat -m`.\n\n## Lost Password\n\nSteps to recover lost password in Ubuntu:\n\n1. Choose your Recovery Mode from Grub menu.\n2. On the Recovery Menu choose \"Drop to root shell prompt\".\n3. At the command prompt enter `ls /home` to list Userids. (optional)\n4. Enter `passwd <userid>` to change the password of that Userid.\n5. Enter `exit`.\n6. On the Recovery Menu choose \"Resume Normal Boot\"."

        "content": "## Notes\n\n* Sample Script: [sample.py](/media/download/sample.py).\n* List attributes of an object: `dir(object)`. \n* Reference object attributes and values via: `object.__dict__`.\n* Check if string is numeric: `s.isdigit()`\n* String and Integer formatting: `'%s%07d' % ('RPT', 7)` gives `RPT0000007`.\n* Identify subclasses: `issubclass(A,B)` returns `True` if A is a subclass of B. (e.g. `issubclass(self.model,Config)`)\n* Check for attribute: `hasattr(object,string)` Returns `True` if the string matches an attribute name.\n* Use tuple packing and unpacking for atomicity: `x, y = y, x+y`.\n* Use generator expressions instead of list comprehensions: `sum(i**2 for i in xrange(10))`.\n* Use decorators to factor-out administrative logic.\n* Use `with` to factor out temporary contexts: `with open('data.txt') as f:`\n* To use UTF-8 characters in code the module must begin with: `# coding=UTF-8`\n* Classes:\n    * Define `__repr__` to return representation of instance.\n* Dictionaries:\n    * Retrieve matching value or default: `var = dict.get(key, default_value)`. Ditto and remove matching entry: `var = dict.pop(key, default_value)`.\n    * Use: `.iteritems()` to retrieve key, value pairs. `del d[key]` to delete.\n    * Key filter: `d = {k : d[k] for k in d if not k.startswith('r')} `.\n    * Construct from iterables: `d = dict(izip(keys, values))`.\n    * Calculate counters by looping through: `d[key] = d.get(key, 0) + 1`.\n    * Combine dictionaries: `d = ChainMap(command_line_args, os.environ, defaults)`.\n* Function calls: Use keyword arguments and return multiple values as namedtuples.\n* Sets: `set_literal = {1,2,3} `\n* Strings: Concatenate with `join`.\n* Loops: Use `xrange`, `reversed`, `enumerate` (not for indices), `izip` (to combine iterables), `sorted(iterable[, key=function])`, `for... else:` Else clause executed on completion of `for` (i.e. skipped on `break`).\n    * `break` ends the entire loop; `continue` ends the current iteration.\n* Operators: Increment `[var] += 1`; Modulo `%`. Ternary operator: `x if a > b else y` Return `x` if `a > b` otherwise return `y`.\n    * `map(function, iterable)`: Apply function to each item in iterable and return iterable of results.\n    * `reduce(function, iterable)`: Function takes two arguments. Apply function to first two items and then to result and next item. Repeat over iterable. Returns single result.\n\n### Python Debugger\n\nAdd the following line to start a debug session at that point in the code at runtime:\n\n    import pdb; pdb.set_trace() # Start debugging\n\nCommands (hit enter to repeat previous command):\n\n* `n` Next\n* `p [name]` Print (`pp` Pretty Print)\n* `c` Continue\n* `r` Continue to next Return\n* `s` Step Into\n* `l` List\n* `b` Breakpoint\n* `q` Quit\n\n### Dictionaries\n\nLoop through keys and values in a dictionary: `for key, value in lookup_address.items()`.\n\nIterate through dictionary in key order: \n\n    for key in sorted(mydict.iterkeys()):\n        print \"%s: %s\" % (key, mydict[key])\n\nAssign matching key or default: `var = dict.get(key, default_value)`. Ditto and remove matching entry: `var = dict.pop(key, default_value)`.\n\n### Exceptions\n\nAccess ongoing Exception information: `sys.exc_info()`:\n\n* Capture last line of traceback and line describing problem to include in a message:\n\n        from traceback import format_exc\n        . . .\n        except Exception as e:\n            trace_info = format_exc(sys.exc_info()).split(\"\\n\")[-4:-2]\n\n* Print traceback: `print 'traceback %s' % (traceback.extract_tb(sys.exc_info()[2]))`.\n\n### Operators\n\n* Increment `[var] += 1`; Modulo `%`.\n* Ternary operator: `x if a > b else y` Return `x` is `a > b` otherwise return `y` (equivalent to `a > b ? x : y;` in Java).\n\n### Interaction with Operating System\n\n* Directory containing current module: `cwd = os.path.realpath(os.path.dirname(__file__))`\n* Relative Paths: `DATABASE_NAME = os.path.expanduser('~/django-reversion/default.sqlite')` or `DATABASE_NAME = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'default.sqlite')`\n* Build path: `PROJECT_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~/code'), 'dmcm/project')`\n* Run command: `p = Popen(\"grep -r --include='*.py' \\\"%s\\\" %s\" % (string.strip(), PROJECT_PATH), shell=True, stdout=PIPE)`\n* Run a script from the Python shell: `execfile(\"/home/ahernp/test.py\")`\n* To find where a module was imported from check its `.__file__` attribute.\n\n### Slicing\n\n* `a[start:end]` Items start through end-1.\n* `a[start:]` Items start through the rest of the array.\n* `a[:end]` Items from the beginning through end-1.\n* `a[:]` A copy of the whole array.\n* `a[::-1]` Reverse the array.\n\nA step value can be used with any of the above: `a[start:end:step]`. \n\nThe `:end` value represents the first value that is not in the selected slice. The difference between end and start is the number of elements selected (if step is 1, the default). \n\nAlso start or end may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning.\n\n* `a[-1]` Last item in the array.\n* `a[-2:]` Last two items in the array.\n* `a[:-2]` Everything except the last two items.\n\nPython is forgiving if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for `a[:-2]` and a only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error.\n\n## Recipes\n\n### Write File\n\n    import codecs\n    def write_file(filename, data):\n        output_filepath = os.path.join(settings.PROJECT_DIR, filename)\n        output_file = codecs.open(output_filepath, 'w', 'utf-8')\n        output_file.write(data)\n        output_file.close()\n        print('Data written to %s' % (output_filepath))\n\nAdd to existing file: `open(output_filepath, 'a', 'utf-8')`\n\n### Remove Substring\n\n1. Find start of substring: `start_pos = big_string.index('/home/')`\n1. Find end of substring: `end_pos = big_string.index(\"'\",start_pos)`\n1. Remove substring: `big_string = big_string[:start_pos] + big_string[end_pos:]`\n\nTo check if substring is present use: `start_pos = big_string.find('/home/')`\n\n### FTP\n\n    import ftplib\n    . . .\n    def ftp_to(filename, pdf_stringio):\n        ftp_serv = ftplib.FTP(settings.FTP_HOSTNAME, \n                              settings.FTP_USERNAME, \n                              settings.FTP_PASSWORD)\n        pdf_stringio.seek(0) # Put file position at beginning of StringIO\n        resp = ftp_serv.storbinary('STOR ' + filename, pdf_stringio)\n        ftp_serv.close\n\n### Sort, Pickle, Hash\n\n    import hashlib\n    import cPickle as pickle\n    . . .\n    # hash a pickle of a sorted dictionary\n    sorted_context = sorted(context.items(), key=lambda t: t[0])\n    pickle_str = pickle.dumps(sorted_context)\n    rml_hash = hashlib.sha224(pickle_str).hexdigest()\n\n### Display Progress Percentage\n\nCalculate and display percentage progress:\n\n    rows = source_class.objects.using('legacy').all()\n    total = len(rows)\n    . . .\n    for i, row in enumerate(rows):\n       . . .\n       percent = float(i) / total * 100\n       sys.stdout.write(\"\\r%2.3f%%\" % percent)\n       sys.stdout.flush()\n\nExample shows percentage to three decimal places, to show percentage as integer use `\"\\r%2d%%\"`.\n\n### Default encoding\n\nCheck the default encoding in python at a terminal with the following commands:\n\n    import sys\n    sys.getdefaultencoding()\n\nIf it is `ascii` then you may get the following error `UnicodeError: ASCII encoding error: ordinal not in range(128)` when processing unicode data.\n\nAvoid this by changing the default encoding to `utf-8` by adding the following as `sitecustomize.py` to the PYTHONPATH and restart python:\n\n    # sitecustomize.py                                                              \n    # this file can be anywhere in your Python path,                                \n    # but it usually goes in ${pythondir}/lib/site-packages/                        \n    import sys\n    sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n\n### Convert to HTML Entities\n\nFrom Unicode: `u'\u00d8stlandet'.encode('ascii', 'xmlcharrefreplace')` gives `'&#216;stlandet'`.\n\nFrom String: `'\u00d8stlandet'.decode('utf-8').encode('ascii', 'xmlcharrefreplace')` also gives `'&#216;stlandet'`.\n"

Sites written in static HTML (e.g. [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde)) generally use much less server resource.\r\n\r\nI have written a [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)-based Content Manager for this site which writes out the HTML when I have finished editing a web page.\r\n\r\nThe main body of each page is stored in a database as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text for easy editing.\r\n\r\nAt present, are only two data structures in the Content Manager:\r\n\r\n1. Pages -- Which merely consist of free-format Markdown and HTML.\r\n1. Lists -- Which are generated using a list item template and set of data lines (see\r\n[Cardgen](/cardgen/) for an example) and then used as the main part of a page.\r\n\r\nEach page on this site, apart from in this blog, now has a footer which shows when the content was last changed and a link to the Markdown source.\r\n\r\nThis is just a proof-of-concept for now. Still to come:\r\n\r\n* Blog application.\r\n* Data structure similar to above Lists but which generate multiple similar web pages.\r\n\r\nIf this works out then I shall make the source code available."

The x-ray showed only 1mm of enamel remained protecting the nerve at one spot.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when fitting the crown the nerve seems to have been have been exposed and killed. This left me with an infection/toothache which got progressively worse. On my next visit the dentist confirmed that the root was now infected. Since my policy is to go for minimum medical interventions we decided to try a course of antibiotics first. He prescribed amoxicillin.\r\n\r\nThis suppressed the infection for a few days but the pain returned before I had even completed the course. The day before my next appointment I got a call to say that it was being cancelled and that the practice was closing for 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I made an executive decision and made an appointment to see another local dentist. Saw him a few days later and told my story. He took an x-ray to make sure nothing weird was going on and suggested that it would be best to allow the original dentist to complete my treatment. He prescribed some much stronger antibiotics (clindamycin) to relieve the pain.\r\n\r\nI called my usual dentist and was given an appointment for the following week. The practice had been closed for only 1 week. When I went in I found that my dentist had had his own medical emergency and been taken to hospital to have an operation on his spine.\r\n\r\nThis time, we agreed that I needed to have an emergency root-canal. I came back 2 days later (on 13 October) and it was done. This was not a painful process but did involve an entire hour in the chair. I started a new course of clindamycin to kill off the infection.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I make a point of using weaker painkillers (paracetamol) so when I took ibuprofen just before the anaesthetic wore off it worked perfectly.\r\n\r\nLast week, (on 21 October) I returned to my dentist who checked the tooth and confirmed that the infection had cleared up. I have to return at the end of November for another check.\r\n\r\nOverall I am happy with my dentist and will continue to visit him. Although something went wrong with the crown, it is partly my own fault for not having the tooth treated earlier. Also, he did point out the risks beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this story is not to carry an infected tooth around with you for a month. It will mess you up!"

(`:b` followed by a space tab completion will cycle through open buffers)\n* `:ls` or `:buffers` Show buffer list. Explanation:\n    * `%` Current window.\n    * `#` Alternate buffer (switch using `:e#` or `:b#`).\n    * `a` Active (loaded and visible).\n    * `h` Hidden (loaded but not visible).\n    * `+` Modified.\n* `:bd` Unload the buffer and remove it from bufferlist (doesn't close Vim, even on the last buffer).\n* `:bun` Unload the buffer but keep it in bufferlist.\n* `:sp [file_name]` Split current window and load file. (`C-w s` split horizontally; `C-w v` split vertically)\n* `:w` Write the current buffer to disk. `:wa` Write all modified buffers.\n* `:e file` Load a file from disk.\n* `:q` Closes current buffer (and Vim if it's the last one).\n* `:new` New empty buffer.\n* `:on` Close all buffers but the active one (`C-w o`).\n* `C-w` and `h j k l` Move between windows.\n\n## Completion\n\nWhile you are typing, it's pretty common to use the same word over and over again. \nUsing `C-p` Vim searches the currently typed text backwards for a word starting with \nthe same characters as already typed. `C-x C-l` completes the whole line.\n\nIf you're not sure how to type some word and you've enabled spell-checking (`:set spell`), \nyou can type `C-x C-k` to do a dictionary lookup for the already typed characters.\n\n## Marks\n\nVim automatically sets various marks like\n\n* `0-9` Last 10 positions of closed files (`0` the last, `1` the last but one).\n* `<` and `>` Left and right position of marked texts.\n* `(` and `)` Start or end of the current sentence.\n* `{` and `}` Start or end of the current paragraph.\n* `[` and `]` First or last character of the last yanked or changed text.\n* `.` Last change.\n* `'` or <code>`</code> Position before the last jump.\n* `\"` Position before the last exit of the file (local to a file).\n* `^` position of the last insert-stop.\n\nTo set a manual mark, use `m[a-zA-Z]`. To jump to one of the marks (manual or automatic) you can choose between `'` \nand <code>`</code>:\n\n* `'` Sets the cursor to the first non-blank character in the marked line.\n* <code>`</code> Sets the cursor to the exact position where the mark was set.\n\nThere is a little difference between lower-case and upper-case characters:\n\n* `a-z` Are local to a file.\n* `A-Z` Are stored and available over sessions (associated with a file).\n\nYou can use `L` for your work-log and `T` for your time-table for example, and quickly update the information there.\n\nFor example you can jump to the last known position of a file before it was closed by typing ``\"` \n(it's easy to configure Vim to do it automatically at start).\n\nTo get a list of all marks Vim knows about type `:marks`. To delete marks use `:delmarks` (`:delmarks a b c` removes marks \n`a` and `b` and `c`, to delete all marks use `:delmarks!`).\n\n## Macros\n\nVim allows to replay some commands using `.`. For more than one command use macros.\n\nYou can start macro-recording using `q` and one of `0-9a-zA-Z`, so for example `qq` records the macro to buffer \"q\"\u009d.\nHit `q` when you are finished recording.\n\nNow you can replay the macro at any time using `@q`.\n\n## Vimdiff\n\n`vimdiff file1 file2` highlights differences between files.\n\n* `]c` jump to next change (`[c` previous change).\n* `:diffget [buffer_id]` replace current change with equivalent in other buffer.\n* `C-W C-W` switch to the other buffer.\n* `:diffupdate` refresh display.\n* `:colorscheme evening` change colours.\n* `:ls` list buffers.\n* `zo` open folded text.\n* `zc` close folded text .\n* `:syntax off `\n* If using only two buffers:\n* `do` get change from other buffer.\n* `dp` put the changes from current buffer into the other.\n\n## Settings\n\n* Interpret all files as UTF-8 by adding the following to `.vimrc`:\n\n        \" Treat everything as UTF-8\n        set encoding=utf-8\n        set fileencodings=utf-8"

E.g. `git clone https://github.com/ahernp/angular-django.git`.\n* `git commit --amend` edit message of most recent commit.\n* `git commit -m \"message\"` to advance the current branch.\n* `git diff [filename]`: To see exactly what was modified.\n* `git fetch`: Update local cache of remote branch.\n* `git log -- [filename]`: Show commit history of a file.\n* `git log -p [filename]`: Show change history of a file (i.e. code changes).\n* `git log`: Show a log of all commits starting from HEAD back to the initial commit.\n* `git mv [filename1] [filename2]`: Rename a file in the repository.\n* `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from remote branch.\n* `git rebase -i origin/master`: Interactive rebase on all commits since last push or merge.\n* `git reflog show`: List all local commits.\n* `git reset --hard [commit]`: Roll branch back to previous commit permanently erasing all newer commits.\n* `git reset HEAD [file]`: Unstage a Staged file.\n* `git revert HEAD`: Remove the most recent commit.\n* `git rm -f [filename]`: Remove file from the repository.\n* `git stash drop`: Delete most recent stashed changes.\n* `git stash pop`: Apply stashed changes and remove them from stash.\n* `git stash`: Moves uncommitted changes to the stash.\n* `git status`: Show which files have changed between the current project state and HEAD.\n\n## Life Cycle of a change\n\n1. Run git status.\n    * Possibly run git stash to hide uncommitted changes.\n1. Create Branch: `git branch <new_branch> <current_branch>`.\n1. Switch to new branch: `git checkout <new_branch>`.\n1. Make changes...\n1. Run `git status`.\n1. Stage all changes to tracked files: `git add -u` (or `git add -A` to add new files also).\n1. Run `git status`.\n1. Commit changes: `git commit -m \"[comment]\"`.\n1. Ensure current branch is up to date: `git fetch`.\n1. Merge branches; At each stage resolve any conflicts:\n    1. Switch to the parent branch: `git checkout [parent_branch]`.\n    1. Ensure branch is up to date: `git fetch` followed by `git merge origin`.\n    1. Switch to the new branch: `git checkout [new_branch]`.\n    1. Merge parent with new_branch: `git merge [parent_branch]`. \nBest to try merging this way first.\n    1. Switch to the parent branch: `git checkout [parent_branch]`.\n    1. Merge new_branch with parent_branch: `git merge [new_branch]`.\n    1. Publish your changes: `git push`.\n1. Delete new branch: `git branch -d [new_branch]`.\n\n## Setup\n\nUse `git init`: to create a new repository.\n\nAdd a `.gitignore` file to the repositories root directory to exclude files from Git\n([example](https://github.com/ahernp/angular-django/blob/master/.gitignore)).\n\n\n### Configuration file\n\n`~/.gitconfig`:\n\n```\n[user]                                                                          \n    name = Paul Ahern                                                           \n    email = ahernp@ahernp.com                                                   \n[merge]                                                                         \n    tool = vimdiff                                                              \n[core]                                                                          \n    editor = vi                                                                 \n[alias]                                                                         \n    co = checkout                                                               \n    ci = commit                                                                 \n    st = status                                                                 \n    br = branch                                                                 \n    hist = log --pretty=format:\\\"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]\\\" --graph --date=short     \n[color]                                                                         \n    ui = auto                                                                   \n[push]                                                                          \n    default = simple                                                            \n                                                                                \n# Use ssh instead of https                                                      \n[url \"git@github.com:\"]                                                         \n    insteadOf = https://github.com/ \n```"

Most are just a matter of common sense.\n\nBear in mind that the Financial Services industry is in the business of making money. Since they are no longer allowed to print it they have to take it from their customers.\n\n## Rules\n\n1. Never Borrow Money (except for a Mortgage).\n    * Have as big a deposit for your mortgage as you can to get a better deal. Pay off the mortgage as rapidly as possible. Earned interest is taxed but mortgage interest payments avoided through early repayment are not.\n1.  Live within your means each month (except for one-off capital expenditure). To paraphrase Dickens:\n    * Monthly Income < Expenditure = Misery\n    * Monthly Income > Expenditure = Happiness\n1. Never buy shares (no exceptions).\n    * The stock market is a casino. As in all such establishments the odds are rigged to favour the house.\n    * Also by avoiding the market you gain peace of mind.\n\n## Tips\n\n* Keep at least one year's worth of salary in a savings bank account for emergencies.\n* Pay bills using direct debits. This lowers the transaction cost & most providers will share the saving with you.\n* Use a credit card for convenience but pay it off each month to avoid interest charges.\n* Advertisers try to trick you into spending money. If you see something you want in a shop or on-line: *don't buy it*.\n    * Instead wait 24 hours. If by then you cannot remember what it was then you didn't really need it and were about to fall victim to an advertisement ploy.\n* *Keep Accounts* It is always a surprise to see where the money is going. When you start delaying expenditure until the next accounting period then you know you are taking it seriously.\n* *Pension Contributions* Save half your age as a percentage of your income into a pension throughout your career to be able to afford to maintain the same lifestyle in retirement.\n    * So when 20 years old you should put 10% of your income into a pension; By the time you reach 40 your contributions should have risen to 20%; And so on.\n* When seeking professional financial advice the first question to ask the advisor is: \"Are you on commission?\" If the answer is anything other than a straightforward \"No\" then that should be the end of the conversation.\n\nBy following these rules, after 15 years working at a mid-level IT job in London, I was able to afford to buy a [mountain](/rooska/) in Ireland.\n"

        "content": "Django is a high-level Python web framework. It has very good documentation at \n[www.djangoproject.com](https://www.djangoproject.com/).\n\n* `from django.conf import settings`\n* To get a timezone-aware current time use from `django.utils.timezone import now`.\n* Check version of Django installation by looking at source of `__init__.py` in django root directory.\n* Return data (not template) from view: `return HttpResponse(data)`\n* Show raw SQL of queryset: `print qs.query`\n* Check version: `import django; django.VERSION`.\n* Run raw SQL: `from django.db import connection; cursor = connection.cursor(); cursor.execute(SQL)`.\n* `from django.contrib.auth.models import User as AuthUser`\n* To get a timezone-aware current time use: `from django.utils.timezone import now` Midnight is `now().replace(hour=0,minute=0,second=0,microsecond=0)`.\n\n## Gotchas\n\n* Fixtures are only looked for in applications with `models.py` modules.\n* HTML `400 Bad Request`: When `DEBUG` is false the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` check is made. Setting `DEBUG` to true causes error to disappear!\n* `ImproperlyConfigured: The included urlconf [project].urls doesn't have any patterns\n in it`: Replace `reverse` with `reverse_lazy`. E.g. Class-based view `success_url` is being evaluated before the URL patterns have been loaded.\n* Initially when a `ForeignKey` is instantiated with a string-based related field, `self.rel.to` is set to the string-based identifier. It is later converted into the class proper. This can cause an error `isinstance() arg 2 must be a class...`.<div>\n  Fix is to ensure that the Model Cache is fully loaded: `from django.db.models.loading import cache as model_cache` then `if not model_cache.loaded: model_cache._populate()`\n\n## Admin\n\n* Site-wide disable deletion on lists: `admin.site.disable_action('delete_selected')` \nin `admin.py`.\n* Specifying `blank=False` and a `default` value removes the empty choice from Admin interface. E.g. `holiday_calendar = models.ForeignKey(Calendar, blank=False, default='ENG')`\n* Change List\n   * Filter using related data (works even for ManyToMany relationships): `list_filter = ['fieldname__relatedfieldname']`\n* Field\n   * `date_hierarchy = '[date_field]'` Adds a date-based navigation interface for that field.\n   * Use `filter_horizontal = ('field_name',)` to get 2-pane many-to-many widget.\n* Inline Admin\n    * Remove empty rows: By default Django displays three empty rows in each inline \n    list. To prevent this add `extra = 0` to the Inline admin declaration.\n    * Remove Delete option: `can_delete = False`\n    * Remove Add button: `max_num = 0`\n* Admin Template\n   * Object can be accessed as `original`.\n   * Model as `opts`.\n\n### Fomfield For ForeignKey\n\nThe `formfield_for_foreignkey` method on a ModelAdmin allows you to override \nthe default formfield for a foreign key field. For example, to return a subset of \nobjects for this foreign key field based on the user:\n\n    class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n        def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n            if db_field.name == \"car\":\n                kwargs[\"queryset\"] = Car.objects.filter(owner=request.user)\n            return super(MyModelAdmin, self).formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\n## Commands\n\n* `python manage.py runserver` Run Django development server. On a remote server use `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:9000`; Project can then be visited using port `9000` on the server's IP.\n* `python manage.py test [app][.TestCase[.test]]` Run unit tests.\n* `python manage.py syncdb --noinput` Build database.\n* `python manage.py shell` Start interactive Python shell with Django environment settings. Uses iPython if it is available.\n* `python manage.py dumpdata --indent 2 --format xml auth.user` Create fixture.\n* `python manage.py help` List all available manage commands.\n* `python manage.py startapp appname` Create a new application.\n\n### Reset Password using shell\n\n1. `python manage.py shell`\n1. `from django.contrib.auth.models import User`\n1. `u=User.objects.get(username__exact='[userid]')`\n1. `u.set_password('[new_password]');`\n1. `u.save()`\n\n## Forms\n\n* Bound Form: Initial data is ignored if a form is bound. (e.g. `form = SampleForm(request.POST))`. This means that it is impossible to update field contents in code. Django actually checks that the `form.data[fieldname]` is immutable.\n* Pass error into validated form: `form._errors['fieldname'] = ErrorList([u'Error message'])`\n* Template\n   * Display field contents in template (works for ChoiceFields): `{{ form.instance.fieldname }}`\n   * Access field id: `{{ field.auto_id }}`\n\n## Models\n\n* `get_or_create` looks for an existing entry where all the data matches. If one of these is a numeric then it must be rounded to match the database contents for this processing to work. Also timestamps of rows created in unit tests may differ by 1 second - can cause intermittent problems of attempting to create duplicates.\n* Proxy Models must be defined with the same `app_label` as the base model. Otherwise no permissions are found and access to the proxy is denied.\n* If a model has a ForeignKey, it will have access to a Manager that returns all instances of the keyed model. By default, this Manager is named `foo_set`, where `foo` is the source model name, lowercased. This Manager returns Querysets.<br>\nIf `Client` model has a many-to-many relationship to `User` then the following will return all the clients related to a specific user: `request.user.client_set.all()`\n* You can reverse filter on ForeignKeys merely by referring to the other model by lowercase name. E.g. `Blog.objects.filter(entry__authors__name='Lennon')`.\n\n### Meta\n\n* The `app_label` model Meta data item must always match the name of the application that the model is declared under. Otherwise the `syncdb` does not pick up the model.\n* Ordering of objects in `models.py` will be used when listing objects on Admin pages. E.g. `ordering = ['something__name', 'something_else__name']`\n* `verbose_name_plural`\n\n### Generic ForeignKey\n\n    from django.db import models\n    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType\n    from django.contrib.contenttypes import generic\n\n    class TaggedItem(models.Model):\n        tag = models.SlugField()\n        content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)\n        object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()\n        content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey('content_type', 'object_id')\n\n        def __unicode__(self):\n            return self.tag\n\n### Natural Keys\n\nA natural key is a tuple of values that can be used to uniquely identify an object instance without using the primary key value. They can be used to serialise data into fixtures to avoid the problem of needing foreign-keyed data to always have the same primary key.\n\nAdd a `get_by_natural_key` function to the model's manager which gets and returns the unique row which matches its parameters. Add a `natural_key` function to the model to return the tuple of data which uniquely identifies a model instance.\n\nSerialise the data using `dumpdata` by adding a `--natural` parameter. `python manage.py dumpdata --natural --indent 4 cm > [app]/fixtures/initial_data.json`.\n\n## Settings\n\n* `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` Default: `/accounts/profile/`. The URL where requests are redirected after login when the `contrib.auth.login` view gets no next parameter.\n\n### MySQL settings\n\n    DATABASES = {\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n            'NAME': 'database',\n            'USER': 'user',\n            'PASSWORD': '',\n            'HOST': '',\n            'PORT': ''\n        }\n    }\n\n## Templates\n\n* Iterate through ManyToManyField contents with `.all`: `{% for keyword in item.keywords.all %}{{ keyword }} {% endfor %}`\n* `TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID = 'Missing variable %s'` Display missing variables in templates.\n* Tags\n  * `{{ value|date:\"[format]\" }}` Format as date.\n  * `{{ value|join:\", \" }}` Will output the items in list value separated by \", \".\n  * `|safe`, `|escape` and `|escapejs` templatetags control how values are added to templates. `|escapejs` Escapes characters for use in Javascript strings.\n* Don't put comma after last item: `{% if forloop.last %}{% else %},{% endif %}`\n* Return data (not template) from view: return HttpResponse(data)\n* `from django.utils.html import strip_tags` Remove html tags from text.\n\n###Iterate through field choices\n\n    {% for id, label in form.banana.field.choices %}\n        {{ id }}': '{{ label }}'{% if forloop.last %}{% else %},{% endif %}\n    {% endfor %}\n\n## Views\n\n* To return no data to a request use `return HttpResponse('')`\n* Return data (not template) from view: `return HttpResponse(data)`\n* User `getlist()` to retrieve list from `request.GET`. E.g. `search_engine_ids = request.GET.getlist('search_engines', [])`\n* Use `from django.conf import settings` to access settings. This contains the application settings at runtime.\n* Show SQL which will be run by adding `query.__str__()` to queryset.\n* Return data (not template) from view: `return HttpResponse(data)`\n* Redirects: `from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect` then `return HttpResponseRedirect('/path/')`\n* Add `help = __doc__` to commands to reuse the docstring.\n* `@staff_member_required`: Decorator to ensure user is logged in and has `is_staff` set before allowing them access to a view. Import: `from django.contrib.admin.views.decorators import staff_member_required`"

        "content": "My thoughts on Fabric after a week of use.\r\n\r\n[Fabric](http://fabfile.org) is a [Python](http://python.org/)\r\nlibrary for running shell commands locally or remotely.\r\n\r\nPython programmers can use that language to write shell scripts.\r\nThus utilizing the syntax of Python to control the flow of logic through the script\r\nwhile using the proven shell commands to manage the system.\r\nFabric helps you do this with its built-in functions:\r\n\r\n* `local` Run a command on your local system.\r\n* `run` Run a command a remote system.\r\n* `lcd` Change the local working directory.\r\n* `cd` Change the remote working directory.\r\n\r\nTo backup the latest version of a local file use:\r\n \r\n    local('cp -u ~/fabfile.py ~/backup')\r\n\r\n(the `-u` update option tells the system to copy only if the source file is newer). \r\n\r\nTo run a command in a specific directory on all the remote servers just say:\r\n\r\n    with cd(code_dir):\r\n        run(\"git pull\")\r\n\r\n### fab\r\n\r\nFabric provides a command-line tool called `fab`. \r\nWhen invoked, `fab` looks in the current directory and up through its \r\nancestors for a file called `fabfile.py`. This file should contain the \r\nFabric commands/tasks which you have written.\r\n\r\nThe command `fab --list` will show all available tasks. \r\n\r\nThe list of remote servers can be set (in `env.hosts`) and overridden \r\n(e.g. `@hosts('localhost')`) in the fabfile.\r\n\r\n### Writing Reusable Code\r\n\r\nTo reuse code in several projects, common structures and processes must be adopted. \r\nIn general, projects have the following lifecycle:\r\n\r\n1. Install the application code from its remote repository.\r\n1. Setup a local development environment.\r\n1. Deliver the changed application code to the remote repository.\r\n1. Deploy the changed application code to the live server(s).\r\n\r\nEach step then has a corresponding task in the project's fabfile: \r\n`install`, `setup`, `deliver` and `deploy`.\r\n\r\nMuch of the logic used to setup a development environment could be \r\nreused when deploying onto remote servers. In order to do so, equivalent \r\nlocal and remote functions need to be made available in the fabfile \r\nwith the same names. For instance:\r\n\r\n    def get_functions(remote):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Return functions which set the current working directory, \r\n        execute commands and check for the existence of files\r\n        either remotely or locally.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if remote:\r\n            return (cd, run, exists) \r\n        else:\r\n            return (lcd, local, lambda path: os.path.exists(path))\r\n\r\nCommon sections of code then begin with a call to get these functions depending \r\non whether local or remote processing is being done.\r\n\r\nThe projects also need to use a common directory structure and all of the \r\nprocessing logic needs to operate relative to the root (topmost) directory.\r\n\r\nWith these prerequisites in place the following common logic can be used:\r\n\r\n    def create_directories(self, dirs, remote=False):\r\n        \"\"\"Create any missing local directories.\"\"\"\r\n        cwd, ex, exists = get_functions(remote)\r\n        root_path = self.live_root_path if remote else self.dev_root_path\r\n        print('# Creating any missing directories')\r\n        for directory in dirs:\r\n            path = os.path.join(root_path, directory)\r\n            if not exists(path):\r\n                print(yellow('# Creating directory %s' % (path)))\r\n                ex('mkdir %s' % (path))\r\n\r\n### Django Commands\r\n\r\nBy having a fabfile in the topmost directory of the project and \r\nwriting a task to run Django commands, you can then execute them from any \r\ndirectory in the hierarchy. \r\nUsing the following task, the command `fab manage:test` \r\nwill run the Django test management command.\r\n\r\n    @task\r\n    @hosts('localhost')\r\n    def manage(*args):\r\n        \"\"\"Locally execute Django command.\"\"\"\r\n        with settings(warn_only=True):\r\n            with lcd(DJANGO_PROJECT_PATH):\r\n                local('python manage.py %s' % (' '.join(args)))\r\n"

Examples: `[A-Za-z0-9]{32}` 32-character alphanumeric; `[1-9][0-9]{2,4}` Number from 100 to 99999.\n* `exchange_rate` not followed by a `,`: `exchange_rate(?!,)`.\n* `^((?!affectv).)*$`: Match all lines without string `affectv`.\n* `<!--[^>]*-->` HTML comments.\n\n## Special Characters\n\n* `.` Matches any character.\n* `(` This marks the start of a region for tagging a match.\n* `)` This marks the end of a tagged region.\n* `\\n` Where n is 1 through 9 refers to the first through ninth tagged region when searching or replacing. Searching for `(Wiki)\\1` matches `WikiWiki`. If the search string was `Fred([1-9])XXX` and the replace string was * `Sam\\1YYY`, when applied to `Fred2XXX` this would generate `Sam2YYY`.\n* `\\0` When replacing, the whole matching text.\n* `\\b` This matches a word boundary.\n* `\\c` A backslash followed on of the following becomes a character class (both inside and outside sets `[]`).\n    * `d` Decimal digits.\n    * `D` Any char except decimal digits.\n    * `s` Whitespace (space, `\\t`, `\\n`, `\\r`, `\\f` and `\\v`).\n    * `S` Any char except whitespace.\n    * `w` Alphanumeric & underscore.\n    * `W` Any char except alphanumeric & underscore.\n* `\\x` This allows you to use a character `x` that would otherwise have a special meaning. For example, `\\[` would be interpreted as `[` and not as the start of a character set. Use `\\\\` for a literal backslash.\n* `[...]` Matches one of the characters in the set. If the first character in the set is `^`, it matches the characters NOT in the set. A shorthand `S-E` (start dash end) is used to specify a set of characters `S` up to `E`, inclusive. The special characters `]` and `-` have no special meaning if they appear first in the set. `-` can also be last in the set. To include both, put `]` first: `[]A-Z-]`. Examples: \n    * `[a-z]` Any lowercase alpha; `[^]-]` Any char except `-` and `]`; `[a-zA-Z]` Any alpha.\n    * `^` Matches the start of a line (unless used inside a set, see above).\n    * `$` Matches the end of a line.\n    * `*` Matches 0 or more times. For example, `Sa*m` matches `Sm`, `Sam`, `Saam`, `Saaam` and so on.\n    * `+` Matches 1 or more times. For example, `Sa+m` matches `Sam`, `Saam`, `Saaam` and so on.\n    * `?` Matches 0 or 1 time(s). For example, `Joh?n` matches `John` and `Jon`."

        "content": "In recent years I've discovered the joys of listening to history podcasters. This consists of mostly amateur historians telling the story of those eras which interest them. All of this content is free and generally of a very high standard. \r\n\r\nMost keep to a schedule of publishing a new episode weekly. Each episode is usually about 30 minutes long.\r\n\r\nTo try them out, I recommend picking an episode from the middle or end of a series - after they've settled on a narrative style. Then start from the beginning if the content appeals to you.\r\n\r\nHere are the ones I listen to most:\r\n\r\nThe big daddy of the movement is Mike Duncan. He did an epic series of podcasts telling the \r\n[History of Rome](http://www.thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) \r\nfrom the foundation of the republic to the fall of the western empire (in 180 episodes). He completed the story in 2012.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Mike is telling the story of various \r\n[Revolutions](http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/).\r\nHe has told the stories of the English Civil War (21 episodes) and the American Revolution (17 episodes) in considerable detail. Now he is in the middle of the French Revolution (31 episodes and counting).\r\n\r\nThe \r\n[History of Byzantium](http://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/)\r\nby Robin Pierson continued the story from where Mick Duncan finished. He is up to the beginning of the eight century (after 67 episodes).\r\n\r\nRob Monaco's\r\n[Podcast History of our World](http://www.podcasthistoryofourworld.com/)\r\ncovers the history of all parts of the world. After 58 episodes he has reached classical antiquity.\r\n\r\nChris Stewart's\r\n[History of China](https://soundcloud.com/the-history-of-china) has reached the end of the Sixteen Kingdoms period in 439 AD (in 57 episodes).\r\n\r\nLast but by no means least of the ancient history podcasts is Paul Vincent's\r\n[Myths and History of Greece and Rome](http://mythandhistory.podbean.com/).\r\nAfter 86 episodes he is in the middle of the crisis of the third century.\r\nHis work is also available as e-books on the Amazon kindle:\r\n[Book 1](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Myths-Ancient-Greece-History-Rome-ebook/dp/B00C8B0K0Y/) &\r\n[Book 2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Ancient-Greece-Myths-Rome-ebook/dp/B00N5TGZZM/).\r\n\r\nFor the modern era, I recommend the\r\n[When Diplomacy Fails](http://whendiplomacyfails.libsyn.com/)\r\nby Zack Twamley. He has covered many wars of the early modern period, the nineteenth century and the first world war (in 83 episodes).\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n[Talking History: The Italian Unification 1790-1870](http://www.talkinghistorypodcast.com/)\r\nby brothers Benjamin and Adam. They have reached the aftermath of the revolutions of 1848 in 48 episodes.\r\n\r\nFinally, I must mention Dan Carling's\r\n[Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/)\r\nHe has done 54 episodes about various periods. His podcasts are infrequent and very long (2-3 hours). The most recent episodes are available for free but the older ones require a small fee. I particularly liked his series of episodes about the Mongols called: Wrath of the Khans.\r\n\r\nLinks to these and other podcasts can be found here:\r\n[History Podcasters](http://historypodcasters.com/).\r\n\r\n\"Share and Enjoy\""

I particularly like the way it models the relationships between different planets in your empire.\r\n\r\nAs a real-time game it makes me worry that I am missing something &ndash; turn-based strategy is more relaxing."

        "content": "Let me start by saying that I don't believe in the occult or that the cards tap into some higher-order plane. I think that they were invented by Carney-folk. Like all such inventions their primary purpose is to separate marks from their money. However, a reader may also dispense good advise.\r\n\r\nYears ago, I read a novel where the Tarot was important. What I remember most is how the characters were often inspired by details on their very ornate cards while thinking about the problems they faced.\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to learn more about the Tarot but wanted to use an illustrated deck where the images are intricate and packed with symbols. Recently I came across the \r\n[Tarot Illuminati](http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/illuminati/)\r\n(terrible name), which fits the bill.\r\n\r\nYou can use Tarot as a tool. The symbolism on the cards in a reading helps the mind to distance itself from the emotional aspects of the issue.\r\n\r\nHere is a trivial example of what I am talking about. I've been working at the same company for a year now and have recently had an appraisal meeting. On balance, I'd like to stay but would not be bothered by starting to look for a new job. They are to come back to me with some sort of offer in mid September which will probably make my decision for me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I did a reading with Tarot cards on the question: Should I stay at my current job? As a beginner, I did a simple three-card spread, where the cards represent: Present, Past and Future.\r\n\r\nI got: The Tower, The Two of Swords and the Seven of Swords. Yikes!\r\n\r\nThe Tower (which has a picture of a burning Tower, struck by lightning with people falling from it) represents disaster! The Two of Swords (illustrated by a blindfolded woman holding two swords) represents choice. The Seven of Swords (the picture has someone taking away five of the seven swords) represents theft. I know that these are gross oversimplifications.\r\n\r\nThe reading was both apposite and unexpected. It put my question in a whole new light. Start-ups are always on the edge of disaster (which is definitely worth keeping in mind); Certainly there is a choice to be made. Am I the thief? Perhaps they cannot afford me! Or are they stealing time from me which would be better spend elsewhere?\r\n\r\nThe human mind is very good at detecting patterns. So good that it sees them where none exist (i.e. in random data). It also works by telling stories. The cards provide enough randomness and archetypical symbols to allow us (or perhaps our subconscious) to see through to the heart of things."

The application server is still implemented in Django.\n\nThis was mostly an exercise in writing a client-side Javascript application as doing that sort of work is a big part of my current job. Since 2010, I have mostly been coding using Python and Django.\n\nAlthough my site is very simple, rewriting it in Javascript is a more complex task than the coding examples which appear in the literature.\n\nAs well as applying some design principals of my own (e.g. everything on the site is text apart from actual images), I have tried to go with the grain of the Angular 2 framework.\n\nAlmost all of the site content is text stored using the\n[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\nsyntax.\n\nWhen the site is initially loaded, the code and current page content is fetched and rendered immediately. The content of the rest of the pages is downloaded in the background. So clicking on an internal link within the site should result in an immediate response without querying the application server.\n\nClicking on an external link leaves the site (and SPA).\n\nThe source code for this site is available on\n[Github](https://github.com/ahernp/angular-django)\n(as is the previous Django version of the site\n[here](https://github.com/ahernp/ahernp.com))."
